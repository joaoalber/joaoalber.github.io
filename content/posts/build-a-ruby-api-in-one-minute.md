Introduction
================

Ruby is known for its simplicity, rapid development capabilities, and reliability. With its powerful libraries and frameworks, you can achieve a lot with minimal effort. Today, we‚Äôll explore Sinatra, a lightweight framework that lets you build APIs in no time. This makes it perfect for creating a Proof of Concept (POC) or small production-ready applications quickly.

### What You‚Äôll Need üìù

*   **Ruby** (latest version recommended)
&nbsp;

*   **Sinatra** and dependencies (rackup and puma)
&nbsp;

*   **Postman** for testing
&nbsp;

After [installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/), install Sinatra and its dependencies:

```shell
gem install sinatra rackup puma
```

Then, in order to check if it's working, create a Ruby file:

```ruby
# myapp.rb
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  'Hello world!'
end
```

Run it with:

```shell
ruby myapp.rb
```

Visit: [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567)

(You are supposed to see the *Hello World* page)

Building the Book REST API
================

Let‚Äôs create an API with a few basic operations to manage books.

Why only a few operations instead all of them? Stick to the final of this article ‚Äî no spoiler ü§ê

### Code Structure

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

# In-memory storage for simplicity
books = []

def json_response(data, status = 200)
  content_type :json
  status status
  data.to_json
end
```

Here we are defining a few things:

- **In-memory storage** - We're using an array for simplicity. For production, you should use a real database.
- **json_response method** - Handles JSON response formatting with content type, HTTP status, and data.

Now, let's build our first endpoint!

### POST /books

```ruby
# Create a new book
post '/books' do
  payload = JSON.parse(request.body.read, symbolize_names: true)
  new_book = { id: books.size + 1, title: payload[:title], author: payload[:author] }
  books << new_book
  json_response(new_book, 201)
end
```

Note that we've added a POST to /books that stands for "create a new book" and we can go from line to line to understand what it's happening:

1. Parses the client's JSON payload into a Ruby object
2. Constructs a new book object and adds it to the `books` array
3. It's the same as "inserting" a new record into the database
4. Sends the created book as a JSON response with a 201 status

Straightforward, right?!

Let's now build another endpoint that will help us to see those created books

### GET /books

```ruby
# List all books
get '/books' do
  json_response(books)
end
```

There's no secret in this one, we already have the data which is an array of books within the variable `books`

*This would be the same as performing a query to bring all the records from a database.*

With those two endpoints defined our final code looks like this:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

# In-memory storage for simplicity
books = []

def json_response(data, status = 200)
  content_type :json
  status status
  data.to_json
end

# Create a new book
post '/books' do
  payload = JSON.parse(request.body.read, symbolize_names: true)
  new_book = { id: books.size + 1, title: payload[:title], author: payload[:author] }
  books << new_book
  json_response(new_book, 201)
end

# List all books
get '/books' do
  json_response(books)
end
```

Testing
================

For testing we are going to use Postman which is a HTTP client that will help us to perform the operations in our endpoints

1. Running the server

```
ruby myapp.rb
```

2. Checking existing books

Perform a `GET /books` request. Initially, the response will be an empty array:

![Example of a GET /books request](https://ucarecdn.com/cc665f95-8508-499e-8dca-60f65ddcdfb2/getbooks1.png)

3. Creating a new book

Send a `POST /books` request with the body:

![Example of a POST /books request](https://ucarecdn.com/ee9eeb3f-0e6f-4ee0-b9af-3112f8156044/postbook.png)

Response:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Harry Potter",
    "author": "J.K. Rowling"
}
```

4. Verifying creation

Perform another `GET /books` request to see the newly added book:

![Example of GET /books working](https://ucarecdn.com/d5725f4b-a8d0-40de-8cd5-17ae6079e8e9/getbooksworking.png)

> VOIL√Å!!! üßô The book is there

Conclusion
================

You've built a simple API in no time! But wait, where are the other endpoints?

**Challenge**: Add endpoints for update, delete, and show operations. Test them using Postman or another HTTP client.
