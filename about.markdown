I've been working as a software engineer for about 5 years, focusing mainly on Ruby/Rails development. Currently working for a US company, Iâ€™ve helped build and maintain backend systems following clean and well-tested code principles.

During my career, Iâ€™ve worked across various business models: **B2B**, **B2C**, and **B2B2C** in startups, fintech, SaaS, and PaaS environments. Iâ€™ve also had the opportunity to mentor less experienced engineers, helping newcomers advance in their careers.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s connect and drive innovation together! ðŸš€
